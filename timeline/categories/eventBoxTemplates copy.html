<!--//
Each event has an ID number which follows this structure e%YEAR%-%SEQ-NUM%. So where ever we create files for events we want to include the ID of the event for which this file is created in its filename.
For example a thumbnail for event with an ID e1878-001 would be thumb-e1878-001.png (file extention according to type of file)

All materials for events are to be saved in the appropriate event category folder.
For example an image file (thumbnail or otherwise) for event in agriculture category with id e1878-001 would go to "events/agriculture/images/" folder and would contain in its filename ID of e1878-001.

Thumbnails for event boxes have to be a 50px by 50px.


Replace all %VARIABLES% with actual values:
- %YEAR% is in XXXX format between 1860 and 2012 - for example "1878", this is the first year in range of years of the event refers to a range of years
- %SEQ-NUM% is in XXX formate between 000 and 999 - for example "001", this is to have events in sequence and distinguish between them
- %CATEGORY% is the name of the category in which this event occurs - for example "agriculture"
- %HEADER% is text that is all in uppercase letters and is centered
- %TEXT% is your normal text

One note: if you have a range of years then %YEAR% in between <h1></h1> tags needs to read your full range for example %YEAR%=1878, but event refers to range of 1878 to 1883 - it would read <h1>1878-1883</h1>

In each event BOX you have space of 5 lines and horizontal text with spaces will wrap at 200px
