<h1>1926</h1>
<h2>Puerto Rican Labor Immigration</h2>
<p>In 1926 the Arizona Cotton Growers Association (ACGA), aligned with multiple governmental agencies including the “The Bureau of Insular Affairs of the Department of the Interior and the Assistant Commissioner of Agriculture and Labor of Puerto Rico”, worked together to bring around 1,500 agricultural workers from San Juan, Puerto Rico to Phoenix (Brown & Cassmore, 1939, pp 66; McWilliams, 1942, pp 79). 

<p>The exploratory venture was plagued with problems. Labor recruiters did not travel to the interior to find agricultural workers, but instead recruited right from the docks of San Juan. The day the first 500 laborers were to leave some 6,000 Puerto Ricans, desperate for work, showed up and rioting broke out. In the resulting confusion families were separated and multiple stowaways hid on board. None of the laborers were actually cotton pickers but instead “building mechanics, cigar makers and coffee, sugar-cane, and tobacco workers” (McWilliams, 1942, pp 80). Untrained in picking cotton the Puerto Rican laborers could not harvest cotton pods fast enough to make a living wage; they soon required government assistance. 

<p>The ACGA claimed it had not had enough time to study the picking conditions in Arizona and could not tell potential workers what to expect. ACGA labor recruiters, as they had in Mexico, misrepresented both the wages and living conditions in Arizona. Potential Puerto Rican laborers were promised “movies and electric lights” in their homes, only to discover tents and filthy living conditions (Brown & Cassmore, 1939, pp 66). Disgusted with the living conditions “ninety [Puerto Rican] men, women and children… camped in the street in front of the offices of the American Cotton Growers Association” (McWilliams, 1942, pp 80). When it was discovered that they had not eaten in three days the State Federation of Labor formed up soup kitchens and bread lines. Then Arizona Governor Hunt asked the ACGA for an explanation to which they responded that tougher loitering laws were needed to “hold the supply of unskilled labor on the ranches” (see McWilliams, 1942, pp 80). Little seems to be known of what happened to the Puerto Rican population after that, but by the next picking season most had abandoned the Salt River Valley and by the late 1930s “no record of a single family” remained (Brown & Cassmore, 1939, pp 67).
