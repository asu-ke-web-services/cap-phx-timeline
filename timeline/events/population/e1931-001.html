<center><h1>The Okies Migration</h1></center>

<p>The combined effects of drought, the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression lead to massive migrations of farmers left destitute in their wake. Often referred to as “Okies” because many were from the state of Oklahoma, these farming families followed the ripening crops across the country looking for work. Estimates of upwards of 400,000 Okies traveled through Arizona in the 1930s on their way to California (McWilliams, 1942, pp 82). Ecological catastrophe and economics had played directly into the hands of ACGA labor recruiters. Cotton growers only needed “to send letters, insert want adds, and post bills in the affected areas to get all the workers needed” (Brown & Cassmore, 1939, 67-8). Recruitment costs dropped significantly, in 1920 about $300,000 was needed to secure 20,000 workers, but under the new regime of migrating Okies, only about $1,000 sourced an army of 30,000 laborers (Ibid).</p> 
	
<p>The ACGA was dissolved in 1933 because it was losing money by advancing money to pickers for travel to Arizona. Normally, the advance would be deducted from pickers wages, but working conditions were so bad that pickers would abandon the contract before the travel advance had been repaid (McWilliams, 1942, pp 83). In place of the ACGA, the cotton ginners organized their own labor recruiting organization under the name of the “Farm Labor Service” (Brown & Cassmore, 1939, pp 68 & 72; Dean & Reynolds, 2006, pp 40) and seemed to operate identically to the ACGA except that it refused to advance travel money to pickers. This reconstitution of the ACGA began to send handbills, like the one in Figure #1 (below), along with labor recruiters to Oklahoma to encourage destitute farmers to head west. The handbills were also distributed at “Arizona’s ports of entry” to coax migrants into the valleys which grew cotton (see Weisiger, 1991, pp 244 and also LeSeur, 2000).</p>

<p>Once again labor recruiters misrepresented the conditions that potential cotton pickers would face. Advertised wages for picking was averaged around $15 - 20 per week for “good pickers”, however actual wages were much lower, and in 1937 true wages were estimated to be between $6 – 8 per person per week (Brown & Cassmore, 1939, pp 1-2). On average only one picker out of 33 would earn the advertised wage while over 50% of pickers earned $8 or less per week. Per person wages would decrease with the size of the family. A husband and wife averaged “$11.57 as compared to $7.95 for those in which one person was working” (Brown & Cassmore, 1939, pp 3). Many pickers preferred to work in California as they could earn between 10 and 15 cents more per 100 pounds there than in Arizona (Ibid).</p>
 
<p>Living conditions among camps in the 1930s are well documented in a Works Progress Administration sponsored survey authored by Malcolm Brown and Orin Cassmore in 1939. An average camp is described as consisting of more then “200 shacks… each about the size of a 1-car garage… some housed as many as 10 during the 1937 season… with one segregated privy for each four shacks” (pp 6). When the shacks would fill up laborers were moved into tents. Poorer camps were reported as “providing none of the ‘luxuries’ described above” (pp 7).</p> 

<p>To understand the diet of Arizona cotton pickers in the late 1930s I quote from Brown & Cassmore’s 1938 study at length (pp 9):</p>

<p>"The diet of the pickers and their families correspond closely to typical poverty diets. It consists almost entirely of cheep, filling, starchy foods. Meat, except for an occasional chunk of 'fat-back,' and vegetables are rarely seen. The mitigating item in the typical southern farm diet, greens, is nearly always absent except in the case of families which are working near the beet and lettuce fields just west of Phoenix."</p>

<p>Health authorities are particularly concerned with the lack of milk for the children of the cotton pickers. One nurse states that milk, even canned milk, is a commodity which she has rarely observed in her visits to the camps. Butter and coffee with canned milk are luxuries reserved for two or three able-bodied men, all good cotton pickers, “batching” together.</p>
