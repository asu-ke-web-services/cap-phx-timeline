<center><h1>1934</center></h1>

<p>On June 30th, 1934, Father Emmett McLoughlin, newly graduated from seminary school, reported for an apostleship position at St. Marie’s Church in Phoenix, Az. The assignment was given to McLoughlin as punishment for insubordination in the seminary. Members of his provincial council hoped that “heat and hard work” would temper his disposition (McLaughlin, 1954, pp 35). Father McLaughlin’s described his first encounter with the slums of south Phoenix in shocking terms. McLaughlin tells us that in the 1930s “Phoenix did not know—or pretended not to know—that it had slums” (McLaughlin, 1954, 41). Called into the community to give last rites to an African-American boy dying of tuberculoses, he describes the scene that confronted him.</p>

<p>"In 1935 most of southwest Phoenix,… was a fringe area “south of the tracks,” between the warehouse district and the city dump, permeated with the odors of a fertilizer plant, an iron foundry, a thousand open privies, and the city sewage-disposal plant." (McLaughlin, 1954, pp 41).</p>

<p>Some barrios suffered from poor living conditions worse then others. In that time the El Campito barrio was also known then as “Little Hollywood” (Dean & Reynolds, 2006, pp 33). During the Great Depression Little Hollywood or the El Campito barrio was described as a “foul slum, the like which can probably not be found elseware in the United States… Open-pit privies are the rules. Sanitation does not exist.” (see Luckingham, 1992, pp 40). Perhaps one of barrios with the most appalling living conditions, El Campito may not have been a solid representation of CCS as a hole. However, sweeping descriptions of living conditions in CCS such similar to those in El Campito abound within McLaughlin’s autobiography. In a few short pages McLaughlin identifies what he sees as the overarching issues confronting the community. He describes the condition of housing as “[b]uilt out of tin cans, cardboard boxes, and wooden crates picked up by the railroad tracks” (McLaughlin, 1954, pp 41).</p> 

<center><h1>1939</center></h1>

<p>In 1939, McLaughlin, with the help of an architect and a reporter from the Phoenix Gazette began an aggressive media campaign exposing the living conditions in south Phoenix to “shame” elites and policy makers into action. From January through March of 1939, McLaughlin would provide photos to his newspaper contact who would print the photos along with a story of the slums on the cover page of the paper (McLaughlin, 1954, pp 54; Luckingham, 1992, pp 154). Concurrently with the weekly printing of the newspaper stories, McLaughlin was appointed chaplain of the Arizona State House of Representatives. He described his approach “I violated the neutrality of the appointment… I pleaded for public housing every day before the session started, and threatened to forget to bless the members if they didn’t pass the enabling law.”</p>

<p>At the end of the session the House of Representatives approved $2,000,000 for the construction of three public housing projects. The mayor appointed McLaughlin chairmen of the newly formed housing authority. “Construction costs were the lowest in the nation: $1,750 per house… Rents were as low as $10 per month” (McLaughlin, 1954, pp 56). Three housing developments resulted from this initiative, named Marcos de Niza, Matthew Henson and Frank Luke, Jr. These three housing developments still exist today as mixed income homes.</p>
