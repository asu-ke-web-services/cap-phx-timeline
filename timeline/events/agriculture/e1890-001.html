<h2>Agricultural Labor Wages</h2>
<p>By the 1890s numerous orchards supplied fruit for drying which also became a profitable export (Shultz & Franklin, 1893). It is also during this time that early hints of race-based agricultural labor exploitation came to the fore. The Phoenix Chamber of Commerce claimed that Pima and Maricopa Native Americans were “self-sustaining and industrious beyond the generality of their kind, constituting a labor reserve that will be appreciated by the valley orchardist” (Phoenix Chamber of Commerce A, 1891).  Later in 1894, the Phoenix Chamber of commerce stated expected wages for laborers as being $20-30 per month for farmhands or  $1.50-1.75 a day for common laborers. The same brochure describes local Mexican American populations as: “A small and scattered Mexican population… found near the cities and villages. They live mostly by themselves, and are a peaceable people, and very valuable to the country as laborers” (Phoenix Chamber of Commerce B, pp 20).</p>
