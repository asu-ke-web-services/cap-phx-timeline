<h1>1911</h1>
<h2>From subsistence to industrialized agriculture</h2>
<p>By 1911 Phoenician agriculture had began to move away from subsistence farming of a diverse set of crops towards monocropping and industrialized agriculture. This move was made possible because “the completion of Roosevelt Dam in 1911 [allowed] production of cash crops [to]…really take off… With a secure water supply now practically guaranteed, crops like cotton, citrus, and lettuce began large scale production in earnest” (Dean & Reynolds, 2006, pp 37). 
	
<p>Agricultural diversity is an important component that should not be brushed over quickly. The general wisdom behind a diverse set of agricultural crops is simple. Firstly, if a crop does fail, say an unexpected hard freeze comes late in the spring and much of the citrus crop is lost, then sale of other crops, say alfalfa, may help farmers through the year. Secondly, if a market for a crop collapses, then again, another species of crop could help farmers survive until the market recovers. A feature of industrialized agriculture is farm specialization concentrating on one or two crops (McWilliams, 1942). This allows for a maximized yield of a specific crop that is expected to make the largest profit. Essentially, an agriculturally diverse set of crops may insolate farmers somewhat to environmental conditions and market fluctuations. While concentration in a single cash crop may be a more profitable strategy, it may also be more risky. 

<p>The loan for Roosevelt dam secured water for flood irrigation of fields, but the projected cost of the dam, $3.75 million, soon ballooned to almost $10.3 million (Logan, 2006, pp 75).  Despite the cost overruns, repayment of the reclamation project needed to be completed in ten years (Lukinbeal et al, 2010). Even though Phoenician farmers had some of the highest average crop values in the U.S., they faced a “double financial burden” including both repayment of the reclamation project and irrigation costs not born by farmers in damper climes while simultaneously prices for staple crops such as corn and wheat were decreasing (Smith, 1986).
