<h1>1918</h1>
<h2>Cotton: The New White Gold</h2>
<p>The outbreak of WWI cut off the U.S., long staple cotton imports (Luckingham, 1989; Lukinbeal, Arreola & Lucio, 2010). While supplies of long staple cotton were plummeting, demand was peaking. Long staple cotton was used in the manufacture of automobile tires. Phoenician farmers had already begun to experiment with cotton cropping as the profitability of cotton began to surge. As early as 1912 some 572 acres of long staple cotton had been planted in Phoenix (Brown & Cassmore, 1939, pp 64), and by WWI Phoenix had established a proven track record of successfully growing long staple cotton (Dimas, 1999).

<p>Such was the need for long staple cotton for tire production that the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company purchased two vast tracts of land around Phoenix to put into cotton production in 1917 (Luckingham, 1989, pp 74; Lukinbeal et al, 2010). The modern town of Goodyear Az., southwest of Phoenix, began with the purchase of 8,000 acres (around 12.5 square miles) of cotton fields by the Goodyear tire company. South of Phoenix, modern Litchfield Park, (named in honor of Goodyear tire company executive Paul W. Litchfield) began as 16,000 acres (about 25 square miles) of cotton fields run by the company (Luckingham, 1989, pp 74).  Despite these vast new holdings of cotton fields, the Goodyear tire company only contributed to around one third of the cotton field expansion that year. Between 1916 and 1918 cotton acreage had increased by almost 950%, from 7,400 to 72,000 acres and was planted in the new “white gold” (Luckingham, 1989, pp 74).
