<h1>1870</h1>
<h2>Agricultural Promotion</h2>
Phoenix promoters wanted to capture westward migrating populations of White settlers to turn Phoenix into a bustling metropolis (Luckingham, 1989). Establishing Phoenix as an emerging agricultural empire would prove to be a successful strategy for attracting outside capital investment and successive waves of migration. With evocative language boosters made bold claims about Phoenician farming that began in the 1870s and would continue through at least the 1930s. The desert was portrayed as a barren wasteland that would be converted by human labor and intellect into an agricultural paradise.

<p>[With] human enterprise and ingenuity, by means of irrigating canals, conducts upon these deserts and streams, which rush down from the lofty mountains that overlook these treeless, lifeless solitudes, a change is wrought, beautiful, magical, and almost incredible. It is as though the Almighty, leaving the walls of Paradise to stand through the long ages in all their pristine beauty and sublimity, had turned away the River of Life from its sin-cursed fields, dooming them to long silence and sterility, till now, in the fullness of time, it pleases Him by human instrumentalities to resurrect and baptize them to a new life, full of freshness, vigor, and transcendent beauty. ~The Garden of America (1885)</p>
