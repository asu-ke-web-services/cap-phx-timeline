<p>During the Great Depression, many South Phoenix residents maintain animal stock and vegetable gardens to survive (Luckingham, 1992).</p>

<p>Investigative journalist McWilliams worked for a short time in Central South Phoenix, during the late thirties. Quoting from him at length:</p>

<p>"[About] 3000 workers are transported, during the season, to and from the fields by trucks. In many cases, workers commute thirty or forty miles a day each way. The trucking is done, for the most part, by labor contractors who usually charge fifteen cents each way for transportation. Lunch Wagons, also operated by contractors, go through the fields at noon. From the lunch and transportation, the contractor usually makes his profit. If workers will not buy his lunches, or ride his trucks, they cannot work in the fields for which he has a contract… Near 16th and Jefferson streets, in Phoenix, the trucks line up at 5 A.M. and the drivers blow their horns and yell “Cotton hands!” In a few moments the trucks are loaded and on their way to the fields. They return to the corner around 9:30 or 10 o’clock at night.  No one sees this daily occurrence, for it begins and ends in the slum quarter of Phoenix, in the early morning and late evening hours, when the shadows are upon the land" (McWilliams, 1942, pp 87-88).</p>

<p>The location specified by McWilliams “near 16th and Jefferson streets” would place this day labor pick up location roughly at the Northwest corner of Golden Gate barrio and within less than a mile walk from the centers of El Campito and Cuatro Milpas barrios.</p>
