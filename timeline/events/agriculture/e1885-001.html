<h2>Expanding Agriculture</h2>

<p>By the 1880s conversion of the desert into agricultural lands was well underway with estimates of 40,000 acres of watered land and another 150,000 acres available (The garden of America, 1885). Fresh produce was supplied by market gardens described by Phoenician boosters as “an industry which will prove highly profitable in… [Maricopa] county it is already followed by Chinese gardeners… Most of the residents of the valley and some surrounding mining camps are supplied by them” (Phoenix Daily Herald office, 1886).</p><br /><br />
