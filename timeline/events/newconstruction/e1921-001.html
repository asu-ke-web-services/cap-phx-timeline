<p>In 1921, Phoenix has 35 miles of paved streets, 64 miles of sidewalks, 125 miles of unpaved streets, and 21 miles of street car lines.</p>

<p>Anglo neighborhoods see the expansion of water and sewage infrastructure. Historic South Phoenix remains outside of the boundaries of the city and residents there receive no such services. <a href="javascript:parent.$.fancybox.open({ href: 'events/politics/e1921-001.html',type: 'iframe'});">For more see politics</p></a>

<p>New technologies like elevators, air cooling systems, and new building materials bring high-rise development to downtown Phoenix (Wilson, Brownell, and Goldfield quoted in Kottlanger 1983).</p>

<p>The canal along Van Buren Street between Central and 3rd avenues is closed to keep cars and pedestrians safe. Workers begin to line other canals with concrete (Kotlanger 1983, 32).  

<p>Landfills open along the Salt River (Bolin et al. 2005, p. 162 citing Mawn 1979).</p>

<p>The city forms a municipal airport.</p>
