<p>The city’s sewer system begins operation in 1911. Some South Phoenix residents will not have access to sewage and waste services for three decades.</p>

<p>The Center Street Bridge crosses the Salt River to connect communities on either side of the banks (De Potter Lykes in Johnson Jr., G.W. 1993 p 222).</p>

<p>The original La Imaculada Concepción de Santa Maria is replaced. Spanish-speaking parishioners are only allowed to worship in the basement of the new church (Oberle and Arreol, 2008,176).</p>

<p>By now, Phoenix has several miles of sidewalk and 100 city blocks of pavement.
The city is still growing. By 1916, it has almost 25,000 residents (Horton 1941, 30-32).</p>

<p>The Phoenix Brickyard is constructed in 1917 in Central City South. It will still be operating in 2012</p>
