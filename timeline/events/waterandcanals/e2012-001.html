<h2>A short historical documetary of canals and water in Phoenix</h2>

<p>"The story of the American West is a story of water, and of our Herculean efforts to capture and spread that water across an arid landscape. As our western cities continue to grow, however, we need to find ways to curb our thirst. In this mini-documentary, ASU researchers talk about the West's water history, our current situation, and some social and technological options for the future."</p>
