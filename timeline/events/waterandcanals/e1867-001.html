<h1>Hohokam Canals Reexcavated</h1>

<p>The remnants of a large system of irrigation canals already existed. A Native American tribe known as the Hohokam had flourished in the area now known as Phoenix between the 7th and 14th centuries and had left a complex series of canals for flood irrigation of farm fields (Plog, 1997). Phoenician farmers only had to clear and re-excavated the old Hohokam canals opening the water channels once more for irrigation of farm fields.</p>

<p>Jack Swilling (seen in his only known photo below) is widely acknowledged for starting the reexcavation by clearing the swilling ditch, later known as the Salt River Valley Canal (Mawn 1977, Horton 1941).</p>
