<p>The Roosevelt Dam is completed, beginning a series of projects that eventually reduces the flow of the Salt River through Phoenix.</p>

<p>The loan for Roosevelt dam secured water for flood irrigation of fields, but the projected cost of the dam, $3.75 million, soon ballooned to almost $10.3 million (Logan, 2006, pp 75). Despite the cost overruns, repayment of the reclamation project needed to be completed in ten years (Lukinbeal et al, 2010). Even though Phoenician farmers had some of the highest average crop values in the U.S., they faced a “double financial burden” including both repayment of the reclamation project and irrigation costs not born by farmers in damper climes while simultaneously prices for staple crops such as corn and wheat were decreasing (Smith, 1986).</p>
