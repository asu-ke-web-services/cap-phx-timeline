<h1>Shade Trees</h1>
<p>â€œDuring the spring of 1872 many shade trees, mostly quick growing cottonwoods, were set out along the streets, and although some of these died, enough still remained to give the town a green and cheerful appearance. Water ditches, or small acequias, ran along each side of the principal streets to supply the necessary moisture, and as the years passed these trees, umbrageous by nature, grew to an immense size, giving a dense and welcome shade to pedestrians passing along the city streets."</p>
