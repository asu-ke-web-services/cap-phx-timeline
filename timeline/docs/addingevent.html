<h1>Creating Event Boxes in Timeline Categories</h1>
<p>This is the piece of code to add into your category timeline file (located in "categories/")</p>
<p>Our eventID convention: e%YEAR%-%SEQUENTIAL% (for example: the first event in year 1860 would be <b>e1860-001</b></p>
<xmp>
    <div id="%%eventID%%" class="eventOuter ep%%YEAR%%a">
        <div class="eventInner pLeft">
            <div class="content linked" onclick="javascript:parent.$.fancybox.open({ href: 'events/%%category%%/%%eventID%%.html',type: 'iframe'}); ">
                <h1>%%YEAR%%-%%LASTYEARINRANGE%%</h1>
                <h2>IN ALL CAPS ARE HEADERS</h2>
                <p>Simple text is marked as a paragraph but is the same size as the header, the text is aligned to center.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</xmp>
<p>Let's consider an event with the following parameters:<br />
	- in "agriculture" category<br />
    - occurs in <font color="#FF6600">1860</font> (not a range of years)<br />
    - has a <i>linked</i> event details file <br />
Code for that event would be:<br />
</p>
<code>
    &lt;div id="e<font color="#FF6600">1860</font>-001" class="eventOuter ep<font color="#FF6600">1860</font>a"&gt;<br />
        &lt;div class="eventInner pLeft"&gt;<br />
            &lt;div class="content <i>linked" onclick="javascript:parent.$.fancybox.open({ href: 'events/agriculture/e<font color="#FF6600">1860</font>-001.html',type: 'iframe'});"</i>&gt;<br />
                &lt;h1&gt;<font color="#FF6600">1860</font>&lt;/h1&gt;<br />
                &lt;h2&gt;IN ALL CAPS ARE HEADERS&lt;/h2&gt;<br />
                &lt;p&gt;Simple text is marked as a paragraph but is the same size as the header, the text is aligned to center.&lt;/p&gt;<br />
            &lt;/div&gt;<br />
        &lt;/div&gt;<br />
    &lt;/div&gt;<br />
</code>

<p>Note about year: we are using the first year in range for position</p>
<p>Not linked event would look like this:
<xmp>
    <div id="%%eventID%%" class="eventOuter ep%%YEAR%%a">
        <div class="eventInner pLeft">
            <div class="content">
                <h1>%%YEAR%%-%%LASTYEARINRANGE%%</h1>
                <h2>IN ALL CAPS ARE HEADERS</h2>
                <p>Simple text is marked as a paragraph but is the same size as the header, the text is aligned to center.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</xmp>
<p>
Event Types:<br />
- Simple Unlinked Centered Text or Headers<br />
- Simple Linked Centered Text or Headers<br />
- Event Box that includes a Thumbnail and other content<br />
- Event Box that includes just a Thumbnail<br />
</p>
<h2>Add the box to category file</h2>
<p>Now that we have our box html we are going to add it to the category timeline file. In this instance we open file "agriculture.html" in "categories/" folder</p>

<h1>Adding Event Details HTML Documents</h1>
1. Create an HTML document (from template or blank)<br />
2. Save this document as "%%eventID%% which looks like this e1860-001 to a file in "events/" folder under the category it resides in (for example: "agriculture/"). Filename would look like: "e1860-001.html"<br />
</body>
</html>
