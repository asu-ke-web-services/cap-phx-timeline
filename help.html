<h3>How the timeline works:</h3>
        <br />
        
        <p>The quantity of data in the timeline necessitates separating the timeline into broad categories. Each entry in the timeline is associated with a category and a date or range of dates.</p>
        
        <p>To progress chronologically through the timeline drag the horizontal scroll bar (see image below) to approximate dates that interest you. To view the many categories use the vertical scroll bar.</p> 
        
        <center><IMG SRC=images/horizontalscrollbar.png ALT="horizontal scroll bar" WIDTH=384 HEIGHT=24></center>
        
		<p>For purposes of comparison categories can be turned on and off using buttons (see image below). So, for example, if you wish to compare categories “climate”, “vegetative cover” and “agriculture” against each other you would click off the other categories so that only the categories of interest are displayed.</p> 
        
        <center><IMG SRC=images/categorybuttons.png ALT="category buttons" WIDTH=384 HEIGHT=24></center>
        
        <p>Many of the data entries are clickable and will link to detailed information relating to the topic and date in the title. The detailed information can include write-ups, pictures, videos, links to outside sources and scholarly references.</p>
