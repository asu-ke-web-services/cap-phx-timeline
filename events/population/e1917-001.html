<h1>1917-1921</h1>
<h2>Mexican Agricultural Labor Migration</h2>
<p>The need for seasonal farm labor, particularly cotton pickers, exploded. Cotton growers formed the Arizona Cotton Growers Association (ACGA). The ACGA quickly aligned itself with railroad companies’ and other southwest interest groups to stress “the absolute necessity of unhindered access to sources of labor south of the border” (Dimas, 1999, 26). By May of 1917 the Bureau of Immigration acquiesced and begin to permit entry of contract laborers to pick cotton. The ACGA paid for transportation to Phoenix (Brown & Cassmore page 64), and $3.00 per day (Dimas, 1999, pp 27), which is the rough equivalent to earning $35.00 per day at the time of this writing (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2012). Between 1918-20 some 35,000 Mexican laborers had been coaxed across the border to meet labor demands (Brown & Cassmore, 1939, pp 64; Dean & Reynolds, 2006, pp 38).   

<p>"[The] majority of these workers found employment in the Salt River Valley. This is more than the total population of the City of Phoenix in 1920. In order to achieve such efficiency in recruitment, the cotton growers spent some $325,000 in recruiting Mexicans and estimated a savings of $28 million to farmers."
