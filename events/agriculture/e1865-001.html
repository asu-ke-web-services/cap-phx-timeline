    <h2>Early Phoenician Agriculture</h2>
    <p>Agriculture in early Phoenix had many advantages over other regions of the United States. With 340 frost free growing days and a winter similar to spring in the Midwest and East Coast, successive crops year round were possible. Large rivers, including the Salt River and Gila River provided year round water for irrigation. The remnants of a large system of irrigation canals already existed. A Native American tribe known as the Hohokam had flourished in the area now known as Phoenix between the 7th and 14th centuries and had left a complex series of canals for flood irrigation of farm fields (Plog, 1997). Phoenician farmers only had to clear and re-excavated the old Hohokam canals opening the water channels once more for irrigation of farm fields. By 1865 the establishment of nearby military outposts and mining camps created a reliable demand for local, inexpensive crops for export to miners and soldiers along with grains and fodder for horses and pack animals (Luckingham, 1992). Within a few short years Phoenician settlers would arrive and turn to farming for generation of reliable income.</p>
